**Termo (Wordly) game made for a graduation project at UFES (Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo)**
<br />**Developers: Thales Melo da Penha && Gustavo Oliveira Cassaro**
<br />
This Termo program uses some important C concepts as:
- Use of Structs<br />
- Abstract Data Type<br />
- Static Memory Allocation<br />
- Text File Reading<br />
<br />
<sub>*Its important to remember that this project may not be 100% otimizated and it probably doesn't use all right concepts of the C language, but at least it works and was crucial to our learning process*<sub />
